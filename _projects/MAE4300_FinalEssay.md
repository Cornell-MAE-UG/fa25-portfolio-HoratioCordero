Identifying Ethical Issues: 

Should MCAS have been concealed from the FAA?
Should management have taken such an aggressive timeline with the development of the new plane?
Should management have committed $1 million to Southwest Airlines for sim racing?
Should the pilots have been told about MCAS?
Should Boeing have gone public about MCAS after the first crash?
Should the technical writers have protested excluding MCAS from the pilots' documentation?
Should the flight dynamics engineers have spoken up?
Should the FAA be deregulating work?

Narrowing the Focus:
Should the FAA be delegating regulatory work?
    If the regulators had done their jobs, the problem would have been mitigated. This is more important than the others because cannon #2 emphasizes the importance of competence.
Should Boeing have prioritized their business success and aggressive timelines or engineering safety?
    Cannon 1 is the most important because the engineers and companies should hold paramount the health, safety, and welfare of the public.
What changes should Boeing tell airlines and the public about?
    One important cannon is cannon for because it is important to avoid conflicts of interest.
    Another important cannon is cannon seven because engineers must issue public statements in an objective and truthful manner.
Should government enforce whistleblower protections?
    cannon nine is important here because engineers should not sanction other engineers for following codes. This enables better sharing of potential concerns without people being afraid of losing their jobs.
Should management have made the decision to cancel MCAS?
    The most important cannon here is cannon two because people making the decisions were stepping out of their area of expertise and should have had greater competence in the area that they were making decisions about.

Determining relevant facts:
Material facts:
1. Boeing Incorporated MCAS to mitigate potential stall (Herkert et al.)
2. MCAS activation was only dependent on one angle of attack sensor (Herkert et al., Science & Engineering Ethics, 2020)
3. MCAS was expanded to low Mach numbers (National Transportation Safety Board, response to final aircraft accident investigation report.)
4. Boeing decided to redesign engines to make them more fuel efficient which required them to be repositioned on the wing (Larcher, Harvard Law school forum on corporate governance)
5. FAA and Boeing agreed to portray MCAS as a modification not a new feature (FAA, 2020, "Timeline")

Individual facts:
1. Mark Forkner lead flight technical team. He knew that pilot training would be costly for Boeing. He did not tell the FAA that it operated at low Mach numbers. (United States of America V. Mark A. Forkner, 2021.)
2. CEO Dennis Muilenberg Press the FAA to allow delivery of planes before they were cleared to fly (Kitroeff & Gelles, NXT 2019)
3. Former CEO James McNerney chose to update the existing 737 design instead of making a new plane to save costs and time (Sterman & Quinn, MIT Sloan, 2023.)
4. Cockpit engineer Said no design changes could be made that would require simulator training (Gelles et al. NYT, 2019.)
5. Faulkner abused his position of trust by withholding critical MCAS info from the FAA (FAA v. DOJ, Press Release, 2021.)

Organizational facts:
1. According to a designer who worked on the 737 Max controls, the design team at times found itself producing 16 technical drawings per week -- double the normal pace (Stermann & Quinn, Boeing's 737 MAX 8 Disasters)
2. Boeing tried to hide the nonconforming parts from the federal aviation administration regulators by moving them out of sight and falsifying records claims Sam Mohawk, the new whistleblower (Isidore, Wallace, "Boeing hid questionable parts from regulators that may have been installed in 737 Max Plains new whistle blower alleges", CNN, 2024.)
3. A designated engineering representative may approve information related to their area of expertise within the limits prescribed by the administration (CFR Title 14, Ch. 1, Subchapter K, part 183, subpart C, 183.29)
4. Mowing promised $1 million per craft with new training requirements to Southwest Airlines (Lorcker, Harbard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance, 2024.)
5. By 2018 Boeing's DER's were certifying 96% of Boeing's work (Herkert et al., Science & Engineering Ethics, 2020)

Making reasonable assumptions:
Missing fact: we don't know whether the MCAS design engineers knew if their designs were getting properly tested and validated.
Reasonable assumption: procedures were being followed (e.g. Pilots test planes with new software.)
Supporting evidence: pilots claimed that MCAS was problematic.

Missing fact: we don't know whether design engineers know MCAS scope was increased to include low Mach numbers.
Reasonable assumption: designers ran test cases only with initial operating parameters, not including low Mach numbers.
Supporting evidence: Boeing executives admitted to changing scope of MCAS even last minute.

Missing fact: We don't know why MK actuation was only related to one angle of attack sensor.
Reasonable assumption: The angle of attack sensors are trusted to work and our pre-flighted before every flight.
Supporting evidence: no redundancies and inherent human error.

Missing fact: we don't know if airlines engineering teams provided pressure or reviewed Boeings changes.
Reasonable assumption: they trusted the Boeing engineering team due to its reputation, and they weren't aware of Boeing's organizational problems.
Supporting evidence: the airline were willing to accept planes before the FAA gave clearance to fly.

Missing fact: we don't know why Boeing promised $1 million per craft to Southwest Airlines
Reasonable assumption: Boeing wanted many pre-orders and assumed success by pushing development.
Supporting evidence: implementation of the same plane but different system let the FAA allow a lack of level B training for 737 Max.

Undertaking definitional clarification

Safety: according to Boeing, ensuring consistent performance through simulation enough of the time. According to the victims travel to and from destination safely for you and loved ones every time.
Regulations: ensuring accurate execution Of applicable regulations. All require requirements are met. Safety for passengers means arriving to the destination in one piece but safety for Boeing is meeting a threshold or acceptable risk level for regulators, it's about policy. For passengers, it's demanding perfection.
Communication: for Boeing, this is dependent on information, considered proprietary or damaging to the business. For the victims, they want clear and open lines of communication. Regulations only raise red flags where pertinent. Communication is dependent on drivers that are business oriented people or oriented and Boeing wants to be efficient and victims want to be thorough.
Innovation: Boeing wants to design a plane at a low cost with maximum financial benefit. The victims want cheaper flights on an efficient plane with an attractive design the regulators want minimal changes in a reliable and trusted design. Boeing is the most incentivized innovate for financial gain passengers may benefit from some improvements, and the FA wants to rely on existing proven design designs.
Consistency: Boeing needs the planes being produced to be the same so that they can deliver the same product to all customers. Victims need the planes to function the same each time they fly regulators need to have the designs be the same so their regulations are applicable.
Trust: Boeing trust the engineers to do enough due diligence that they will produce planes that work reliably, and the victims trust that the plane will function regulators trust Boeing to regulate themselves.

Conducting ethical analysis:

Should the FAA be allowing DERs to self certify the development of new systems on the 737 Max?
Stakeholders:
    Primary: FAA, Boeing, DER
    Secondary: C suite executives, engineers, airlines, passengers
    Decision maker: regulatory body within the FAA
ASME cannons: 2, 4, 7, 9
There's a conflict between four and seven because four says to be faithful to the employer, whereas seven says to be truthful to the public. Since the employer is Boeing, which is trying to overlook the safety concern of MCAS, the engineers are conflicted that they would not both be able to be truthful (exposing MCAS) And faithful to Boeing's wishes (hiding MCAS). Cannon 7 takes precedence because it is much more important to alert the public of a safety concern that to try and protect the employer.

Should Boeing management have prioritized business, success, and aggressive timelines or engineering safety?
Stakeholders:
    Primary: engineering DERs, C suite executives
    Secondary: airlines, passengers, ground technicians, pilots
    Decision makers: Boeing C suite
ASME cannons: 1, 4, 7, 8
Cannon 1 and 4 conflict because Canon four says to be faithful to the employer while one says to hold health and safety paramount. Boeing's goal is to push aggressive timelines and get MCAS implemented, but the health and safety concerns are at odds with this goal. Cannon 1 takes precedence because safety is always more important than business needs.

What changers should Boeing Senior engineers have communicated to airlines the FA and the general public about the development of MCAS?
Stakeholders:
    Primary: engineers, Boeing management, DERs
    Secondary: airlines, FAA, pilots
    Decision-maker: Boeing management
ASME Cannons: 1, 2, 6, 7
There is a conflict between one and six because engineers should always hold health and safety Paramount, but according to six they should not associate with not reputable organizations. Boeing is not reputable because it is not holding health and safety paramount. Cannon 1 always is the most important because health and safety takes precedence over everything.

Should Boeing DERs have certified the new MCAS design on the 737 Max knowing that they were largely untested and had a single angle of attack sensor?
Stakeholders:
    Primary: Boeing DERs, FAA
    Secondary: pilots, passengers, ground technicians
    Decision-maker: Boeing DERs, C suite executives.
ASME canons: one, three, five, nine
Cannon 3 (continuing professional development) and cannon 5 (respect proprietary information) conflict. Boeing engineers are motivated to continue professional development, but the development of MCAS emphasizes keeping the information about MCAS private and confidential 10 and three takes precedence because it is not important for the Boeing engineers to be keeping secrets in the first place should be public knowledge, and the engineers should take advantage of that learning to advanced their careers.

Should the government have done a better job enforcing whistleblower, protections, and enforcing a culture of information sharing and accountability?
Stakeholders:
    Primary: Boeing engineers and senior engineers, FAA, government
    Secondary: general public, airlines
    Decision makers: FAA, Boeing senior management
ASME cannons: nine, five, one, four
Canon nine conflicts with canon four. Number four holds engineers accountable to Boeing, which could cause one engineer to out another, but Canon nine says that they should not retaliate if they are acting ethically, and in the interest of the general public can take precedence because in order to keep everyone safe, the engineers, making poor decisions that must be punished.

Resolving the issue:

Should the government have done a better job enforcing whistleblower protections?
A culture of trust would've allowed engineers to speak out with their concerns and have had MCAS be evaluated more fully.
Facts:
Boeing tried to hide non-conforming parts from the FAA contributing to their culture of deception.
Mark Forkner hid MCAS from the FAA again contributing to their lack of transparency.
Assumptions:
We can assume Boeing engineers thought they would be retaliated against for alerting regulatory bodies to the problem of MCAS
Cannons:
Canon nine says that engineers shouldn't retaliate against each other for following ethical standards, even when going against their company.
Justification: if Boeing engineers had felt safe speaking out about their concerns about MCAS their issues should have been tested.

Should Boeing management have prioritized aggressive timelines for customer, success or engineering safety through rigorously testing MCAS? Based on Canon one, management should have put public safety before the success of the company and rigorously tested validated and approved MCAS.
Facts: 
Boeing promised $1 million per plane with new training requirements to Southwest Airlines.
Boeing promised $1 million per plane with new training requirements to Southwest Airlines.
CEO Pressed FAA to allow delivery of planes before they were certified to fly.
Assumptions:
We can assume airlines trusted the Boeing engine engineering team due to its reputation and weren't aware of organizational problems.
Cannons:
Canon seven says that engineers should only issue true statements, so management should have been more transparent about changes and timelines
Justification:
Management should have been more communicative (cannon 1)

What changes should Boeing senior engineers have communicated about MCAS?
Senior engineers should have disclosed the full operation of MCAS in technical manual, public statements per Canon, seven and one
Facts:
The FAA and Boeing agreed to portray MCAS as a modification, not as a new feature
Mark Forkner wanted MCAS concealed to prevent high training cost
Assumptions:
Makers of MCAS didn't think it was necessary for pilots to know about the existence of the system.
Cannons:
Canon one says that engineer should have told pilots about MCAS so they could fly safely.
Canon two says that senior engineers and management shouldn't have been the ones to conceal MCAS because they didn't design it
Justification:
If MCAS had been disclosed to pilots and the actual responsible engineers for MCAS had decided to communicate about MCAS then MCAS could have been used more safely by the pilots.

Avoiding ethical problems: 
MCAS should have been certified by the people who originally determined the scope of the system.
Individual level:
Engineers should have been trained in the certification processes so they could understand how their work was being certified and take extreme ownership over their work.
Organizational level:
The people doing the work should have been encouraged to actually certify their work and stay more engaged with the process.
Systemic:
The FAA should have been more engaged in the certification process and more actively participated in ensuring that Boeing's DERs were upholding the most rigorous engineering processes.

Management should have put engineering safety over the financial success of the company
Individual level:
Members of management should have been forced to take more extensive ethical training and should have put less workload on the design engineers.
Organizational level:
Boeing should have had standards and policies for new aircraft development.
Systemic level:
The government should have enforced minimum amounts of ethical training across all industries for all levels of employees.

Senior engineers should have disclose the full operation of MCAS in technical manuals and public statements.
Individual level:
Engineers should have emphasized clarity of information in all work that they own. They should also have been trained on conveying the right information successfully.
Organizational level:
Boeing should have created standardized templates for all training manual and created a space to learn and ask questions.
Systemic level:
Companies should provide a quarterly to regulators and general public thoroughly stating change changes. These updates should also be thoroughly audited.

DERs should have put public safety first and not certified a life critical system with a zero fault tolerance without a redundant sensor.
Individual level:
DERs should receive training coordinated by the FAA or proper certification processes, and technical decisions to ensure they're following the most up-to-date procedure procedures.
Organizational level:
Boeing should have created a culture where the D ER's could feel independent making decisions.
Systemic level:
The FAA should have audited the DERs' work and provided changes for incorrect work.

A culture of trust should have allowed engineers to speak out with concerns and have had MCAS be evaluated more thoroughly
Individual level:
Individual DER's should have expressed their concern to their lower level managers without fear of retaliation, and then those managers could have reported their concerns to upper level management anonymously.
Organizational level:
Boeing should have made an anonymous reporting tool for DERs to express their concerns without fear of retaliation.
Systemic level:
There should be more robust laws in place for whistleblower protections. This would encourage the DERs To report issues without losing their job or getting retaliation from management.
